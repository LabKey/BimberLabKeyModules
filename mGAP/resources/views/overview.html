The Macaque Genotype and Phenotype Database (mGAP) provides access to genotype data collected on a large, pedigreed, rhesus macaque colony housed at the Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC), ultimately including data from thousands of animals.
The initial data release of mGAP includes a catalog of DNA sequence variants generated from whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 54 rhesus macaques.
The genotype data set, along with clinical and phenotypic measures on the same animals, will be updated periodically.
